      text: 'Stromberg guitars are known around the world as premier archtop guitars with a reputation for sound and playability. Designed and built to excel in the big band jazz setting, Stromberg guitars have always been known for their high quality construction and the ability to “cut through the mix”. Today’s Stromberg guitars continue that tradition and stay true to the legacy of this iconic brand.'
